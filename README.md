  <h1>UNICEF Malnutrition Data Visualization</h1>
  <h2>Project Overview</h2>

  <p>This project focuses on the in-depth analysis and visualization of malnutrition data across UN regions over different years. The dataset utilized in this project is sourced from UNICEF and can be found <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/corgiredirector?site=https%3A%2F%2Fdata.unicef.org%2Fresources%2Fdataset%2Fmalnutrition-data%2F">here</a>.</p>

  <h2>Dataset Overview</h2>

  <p>The dataset encompasses various malnutrition factors, including severe wasting, wasting, overweight, stunting, and underweight. Through extensive analysis, this project aims to uncover insights into the prevalence and trends of malnutrition across different regions and years.</p>

  <h3>Technologies Used</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Python Pandas:</strong> Employed for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the structure and content of the malnutrition dataset.</li>
    <li><strong>Plotly:</strong> Utilized for data visualization, providing interactive and visually compelling plots and charts.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>How to Explore</h3>

  <p>To explore the analysis and visualizations locally, you can use the provided Python notebook available in this repository. Download the notebook and run it in your preferred Python environment to delve into the detailed exploration of malnutrition factors across UN regions.</p>

  <h3>Visualizations</h3>

  <p>The project utilizes Plotly to create interactive visualizations that enhance the understanding of malnutrition patterns. The visualizations focus on severe wasting, wasting, overweight, stunting, and underweight factors, providing a comprehensive view of the malnutrition landscape.</p>
